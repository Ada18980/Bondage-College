## Introduction

[Back to the contents](#table-of-contents)

Congratulations! You've been accepted as an official member of the Bondage Club! The club is a big and often confusing place, and we know that sometimes it can be difficult for new members to learn their way around. But worry not! We have compiled this handy guide which (hopefully) covers everything you need to know about your Bondage Club membership!

**Note:** We're always looking to improve our new member experience. If you notice any mistakes in this manual, or think we've missed out some information about the club that should be here, please do get in touch with a member of the Bondage Club Development Team and let us know. The best way to report such issues is via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/dkWsEjf), [DeviantArt](https://ben987.deviantart.com/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BondageProjects/).

Of course, we can't possibly document every tiny hidden secret about the club, and if you're a new member, we do encourage you to explore the club and discover what it can offer on your own initiative. But hopefully this guide will prove to be a useful reference for you throughout your time at the club.

Once again, welcome to the Bondage Club, and we hope you enjoy your membership!
